In recent years,Philippines,Malaysia,Thailand and Indonesia,their percentage of the population living in cities have been growing.But they have obviously different rising types.Philippines is started from above 30%,and down to almost 40% when it is closed to 50%,and continue to keep rising.Malaysia is started from 30%,and always keeps a fast speed rising, which is gradually in slow speed.Thailand is started from below 20% and relatively presented in a slow rising speed and in a stable status.Indonesia is started from above 10% that is a shortest level and keep a high speed rising.With prediction data, they will keep rising and turn to a slow and steady speed, but Thailand,which will be in a very high speed.To be concluded, these countries's percentage of the population living in cities all will grow, and it can't be stopped.

The graph provides information on the percentage of people living in cities in four Asian countries (Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia) from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040. Overall, the urban population in all four countries has been increasing steadily, though at different rates.

In the Philippines, the percentage started at above 30% in 1970 and ==saw== ==a slight dip==around 1990, reaching almost 40%, before continuing to rise steadily. Malaysia, which also began at 30%, experienced the most rapid growth, with ==urbanization== levels surpassing 70% by 2020. This ==upward== trend is expected to slow down slightly in the future.

Thailand, on the other hand, started with a much lower urban population, below 20% in 1970. Its growth was more gradual compared to the other countries, reaching around 50% by 2020. ==In contrast==, Indonesia had the lowest starting point, with only about 10% of its population living in cities in 1970, but it has since seen rapid urbanization, reaching almost 60% by 2020.

Looking ahead, all countries are expected to see further growth in urban populations, though at a slower pace. Malaysia and the Philippines are projected to stabilize at higher levels, while Thailand and Indonesia are likely to experience significant increases.

In conclusion, while all four countries are experiencing growth in urban populations, the rates and starting points differ, with Malaysia and the Philippines leading the way, and Thailand and Indonesia gradually catching up.

### （1） 拟人化

​	在句子里，“百分比”被拟人化了，好像它能“看到”某种变化，实际上是表示“百分比经历了一些变化”。

​	“The market saw an increase in prices.”（市场见证了价格的上涨。）

​	“The country saw rapid industrialization.”（国家经历了快速工业化。）

​	“see” (见证、经历)、 “experience” (经历)、 “witness” (目睹)、 “suffer” (遭受) 。通常用这些动词来描述非人的事物（如趋势、数字、时间段等）时，它们更容易被拟人化。

​	“The economy **saw** a steady increase.”

​	“The year **witnessed** major political changes.”

​	“The company **experienced** significant growth.”

# Writing Task 2

## 1.my writing

I disagree with the statement is that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.

First of all, everyone still get old although we do have method to improve our lives.You can image a scene that many old people they just use their unhealthy body to try to earn money to handle with the difficulty of the life,and with no one can afford to do the high risk job, which can also cause the problem of people's living place shortage.It even means young people need to pay more attention to take care of the older, which will decrease their time creating something new and push society to move forward.

Secondly,the rate of birth will be less than ever.Young people don't have enough time and  money to bear a new baby .In such case,the old people will be the most majority consist of the world.More and more places are taken, no place will remain for new chance.

Thirdly,the speed of creation will be down to the zero.while the most of people can't do the creation and realize their dream, the society will end eventually, with never ever new space for science.

Above all, considering that aim of science should be to improve people's lives as the most important thing, it is a really ridicurous thought.We should show our respect to the rule of nature is that feature's cell will get old and will die while assumulate enough,until we can solve these all problems completely.

## 2.修改之后

*I disagree with the idea that the ==primary== goal of science should be to ==improve people’s lives==, as this could lead to unintended negative consequences.*

*One major issue with focusing science ==solely== on improving people’s lives is that it may lead to an ==aging population==. Even if science can extend lifespans, this may result in more ==elderly== people unable to work, causing economic ==strain== on society. Younger generations might have to ==take on== more ==caregiving== responsibilities, which could limit their ability to ==innovate== and contribute to society.*

*Another issue is that focusing too much on improving current lives might ==discourage== younger generations ==from== starting families <u>due to increased costs of living and caregiving</u>. This could lead to a ==declining== birth rate, causing an ==imbalance== in the population, where the elderly ==vastly== ==outnumber== the young.*

*==Furthermore==, a society focused ==solely== on maintaining or improving lives may see a decline in creativity and ==innovation==. If most resources are directed toward preserving the current population rather than ==foster==ing new ideas, the pace of scientific and technological ==breakthroughs== could slow down, ==ultimately== limiting future progress.*

*In conclusion, while improving people’s lives is an important goal of science, it should not be the primary focus. Overemphasizing this aim could lead to an aging population, lower birth rates, and reduced innovation, ultimately hindering society’s progress. Science should balance improving lives with advancing knowledge and discovery for future generations.*

## 3.总结

1. ==每段的写法==：每个段落开头应有一个明确的主题句，随后通过具体的细节支持论点，最后用总结句收尾。

2. ==段落之间的过渡==：从老龄化问题到出生率下降，再到创新速度减慢的论述，缺少一个清晰的逻辑链。

3. ==更直接连接论点==：需要更多的展开和更明确的论证，以直接连接到“科学最重要的目标应是改善人类生活”的论点上。

4. ==学会使用各种连接词==：单独开一页笔记吧。
